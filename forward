# Syntax to pipe the message to a command differs.
# If one of the pipe commands below doesn't work
# try one of the following alternatives:
#
# |/full/path/to/cmd
# |"/full/path/to/cmd args"
# "|/full/path/to/cmd args"

# Prevent local delivery
########################

# Ensure that mail is never delivered locally
/dev/null

# Alternative syntax if local file delivery is restricted 
# (SafeFileEnvironment in Sendmail), but piping messages is allowed
# (F=| flag in Sendmail)
#|"cat /dev/null"

# Process with procmail
#######################

#|"exec /usr/bin/procmail"
# Exim needs another syntax
#|/usr/bin/procmail

# Really forward
################

# Just an example, replace with real address
