  # This is important!
  # EOL conversion is handled by the following settings
  # (first value in the list is the default value)
  # core.autocrlf  false, true, input
  # core.safecrlf  false, true, warn
  # core.eol       native, lf, crlf
  # Best explanation I found so far:

  # I prefer a config where git would never do automatic conversion 
  # but refuses files with CRLF, so I can convert them myself.
  # With autocrlf = input git will convert CRLF on the way to the
  # repo and will do nothing on the way out of the repo. 
  # safecrlf = true throws an error when conversion would not be 
  # reversible. The combination of both will throw an error on every
  # file that contains CRLF.

  # Github also recommends core.autocrlf = input
  # https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings

  autocrlf = input  # input = convert to lf when writing in repo, 
                    # don't convert when writing in working copy
  # core.autocrlf = input doesn't play well with git-svn however,
  # so for git-svn repos set it to false.
  #autocrlf = false

  safecrlf = true # Should be enabled, no matter how autocrlf is set
                  # Behavior depends on autocrlf setting, with 
                  # autocrlf = input git add throws an error on 
                  # every file with CRLF
                  # With autocrlf = false this setting doesn't matter

  # Be strict about whitespace and prefer spaces over tabs.
  # This setting does not apply to git add, because git add does not 
  # whitespace checking.
  # Default values are pretty strict already, just forbid tabs in indent
  # and set shallow tab width.
  whitespace = tab-in-indent, tabwidth = 2
	
  # When core.autocrlf = false (see above), whitespace handling needs to
  # be told about possible CRLFs.
